    """
    This function takes in a list of Py-ART Grid objects and derives a
    wind field. Every Py-ART Grid in Grids must have the same grid
    specification. 

    In order for the model data constraint to be used,
    the model data must be added as a field to at least one of the
    grids in Grids. This involves interpolating the model data to the
    Grids' coordinates. There are helper functions for this for WRF
    and HRRR data in :py:func:`pydda.constraints`:

    :py:func:`make_constraint_from_wrf`

    :py:func:`add_hrrr_constraint_to_grid`

    Parameters
    ==========

    Grids: list of Py-ART Grids
        The list of Py-ART grids to take in corresponding to each radar.
        All grids must have the same shape, x coordinates, y coordinates
        and z coordinates.
    u_init: 3D ndarray
        The intial guess for the zonal wind field, input as a 3D array
        with the same shape as the fields in Grids.
    v_init: 3D ndarray
        The intial guess for the meridional wind field, input as a 3D array
        with the same shape as the fields in Grids.
    w_init: 3D ndarray
        The intial guess for the vertical wind field, input as a 3D array
        with the same shape as the fields in Grids.
    vel_name: string
        Name of radial velocity field. Setting to None will have PyDDA attempt
        to automatically detect the velocity field name.
    refl_field: string
        Name of reflectivity field. Setting to None will have PyDDA attempt 
        to automatically detect the reflectivity field name.
    u_back: 1D array
        Background zonal wind field from a sounding as a function of height.
        This should be given in the sounding's vertical coordinates.
    v_back: 1D array
        Background meridional wind field from a sounding as a function of
        height. This should be given in the sounding's vertical coordinates.
    z_back: 1D array
        Heights corresponding to background wind field levels in meters. This
        is given in the sounding's original coordinates.
    frz: float
        Freezing level used for fall speed calculation in meters.
    Co: float
        Weight for cost function related to observed radial velocities.
    Cm: float
        Weight for cost function related to the mass continuity equation.
    Cx: float
        Weight for cost function related to smoothness in x direction
    Cy: float
        Weight for cost function related to smoothness in y direction
    Cz: float
        Weight for cost function related to smoothness in z direction
    Cv: float
        Weight for cost function related to vertical vorticity equation.
    Cmod: float
        Weight for cost function related to custom constraints.
    weights_obs: list of floating point arrays or None
        List of weights for each point in grid from each radar in Grids.
        Set to None to let PyDDA determine this automatically.
    weights_model: list of floating point arrays or None
        List of weights for each point in grid from each custom field in
        model_fields. Set to None to let PyDDA determine this automatically.
    weights_bg: list of floating point arrays or None
        List of weights for each point in grid from the sounding. Set to None
        to let PyDDA determine this automatically.
    Ut: float
        Prescribed storm motion in zonal direction.
        This is only needed if Cv is not zero.
    Vt: float
        Prescribed storm motion in meridional direction.
        This is only needed if Cv is not zero.
    filt_iterations: int
        If this is greater than 0, PyDDA will run a low pass filter on
        the retrieved wind field and then do the optimization step for
        filt_iterations iterations. Set to 0 to disable the low pass filter.
    max_outside_opt: bool
        If set to true, wind values outside the multiple doppler lobes will
        be masked, i.e. if less than 2 radars provide coverage for a given
        point.
    max_iterations: int
        The maximum number of iterations to run the optimization loop for.
    max_w_outside_opt: bool
        If set to true, vertical winds outside the multiple doppler lobes will
        be masked, i.e. if less than 2 radars provide coverage for a given
        point.
    filter_window: int
        Window size to use for the low pass filter. A larger window will
        increase the number of points factored into the polynomial fit for
        the filter, and hence will increase the smoothness.
    filter_order: int
        The order of the polynomial to use for the low pass filter. Higher
        order polynomials allow for the retention of smaller scale features
        but may also not remove enough noise.
    min_bca: float
        Minimum beam crossing angle in degrees between two radars. 30.0 is the
        typical value used in many publications.
    max_bca: float
        Minimum beam crossing angle in degrees between two radars. 150.0 is the
        typical value used in many publications.
    upper_bc: bool
        Set this to true to enforce w = 0 at the top of the atmosphere. This is
        commonly called the impermeability condition.
    model_fields: list of strings
        The list of fields in the first grid in Grids that contain the custom
        data interpolated to the Grid's grid specification. Helper functions
        to create such gridded fields for HRRR and NetCDF WRF data exist
        in ::pydda.constraints::. PyDDA will look for fields named U_(model
        field name), V_(model field name), and W_(model field name). For
        example, if you have U_hrrr, V_hrrr, and W_hrrr, then specify ["hrrr"]
        into model_fields.
    output_cost_functions: bool
        Set to True to output the value of each cost function every
        10 iterations.

    Returns
    =======
    new_grid_list: list
        A list of Py-ART grids containing the derived wind fields. These fields
        are displayable by the visualization module.
